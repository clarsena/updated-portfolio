		"bio": "My name is Christopher, I'm a Full Stack ReactJS Developer. Currently working at Kenna while also freelancing in my spare time. I have always loved problem solving and logic puzzles, so I found the transition into coding to be a natural fit for me. I've been fascinated with computers and the tech world since I was very little and cannot wait to continue to learn and grow in the web development world. When I'm not coding, I can be found in the kitchen whipping up a new dish or baking some tasty treats, spending time with my wife and kids or practicing my photography skills. I look forward to joining a team that shares my passion for coding and will continue to push me to reach new heights.",
